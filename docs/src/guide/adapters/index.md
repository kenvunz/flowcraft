# Distributed Execution: Official Adapters

Flowcraft's progressive scalability is enabled by its adapter-based architecture. You can develop your workflow's business logic once and then deploy it to different distributed systems by simply swapping in the appropriate adapter.

Each adapter provides the necessary components to bridge Flowcraft's core runtime with specific message queues, databases, and coordination stores.
