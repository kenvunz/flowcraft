# Observability and Events

## Event Bus

Flowcraft provides an event bus for observability, allowing you to monitor workflow execution in real-time. The runtime emits various events during execution, which can be used for logging, monitoring, or triggering external actions.

### Available Events

The event bus uses structured events for observability. See the [`FlowcraftEvent`](/api/runtime#flowcraftevent-type) type definition and detailed descriptions of all available events.

### Event Descriptions

- **`workflow:start`**: Emitted when a workflow execution begins.
- **`workflow:finish`**: Emitted when a workflow completes, fails, or is cancelled.
- **`workflow:stall`**: Emitted when a workflow cannot proceed (e.g., due to unresolved dependencies).
- **`workflow:pause`**: Emitted when a workflow is paused (e.g., due to cancellation or stalling).
- **`workflow:resume`**: Emitted when a workflow resumes execution.
- **`node:start`**: Emitted when a node begins execution, including the resolved input.
- **`node:finish`**: Emitted when a node completes successfully.
- **`node:error`**: Emitted when a node fails.
- **`node:fallback`**: Emitted when a fallback node is executed.
- **`node:retry`**: Emitted when a node execution is retried.
- **`node:skipped`**: Emitted when a conditional edge is not taken.
- **`edge:evaluate`**: Emitted when an edge condition is evaluated, showing the condition and result.
- **`context:change`**: Emitted when data is written to the workflow context.
- **`batch:start`**: Emitted when a batch operation begins.
- **`batch:finish`**: Emitted when a batch operation completes.
- **`job:enqueued`**: Emitted when a job is enqueued for distributed processing.
- **`job:processed`**: Emitted when a distributed job completes successfully.
- **`job:failed`**: Emitted when a distributed job fails.

### Using the Event Bus

You can provide a custom event bus when creating the runtime:

```typescript
import type { IEventBus } from 'flowcraft'

const eventBus: IEventBus = {
	async emit(event) {
		console.log(`Event: ${event.type}`, event.payload)
		// Send to monitoring service, etc.
	},
}

const runtime = new FlowRuntime({
	registry: myNodeRegistry,
	eventBus,
})
```

For the complete `FlowcraftEvent` type definition, see the [Runtime API documentation](/api/runtime#event-bus).

This allows you to integrate with tools like OpenTelemetry, DataDog, or custom logging systems for comprehensive observability.

## `InMemoryEventLogger`

The `InMemoryEventLogger` acts as a "flight recorder" for debugging complex workflow executions. It captures all events emitted during a workflow run, allowing you to inspect the sequence of operations, data flow, and errors in detail.

### Usage

```typescript
import { createFlow, FlowRuntime } from 'flowcraft'
import { InMemoryEventLogger } from 'flowcraft/testing'

const eventLogger = new InMemoryEventLogger()
const runtime = new FlowRuntime({
	eventBus: eventLogger,
})

const flow = createFlow('my-workflow').node('a', () => ({ output: 'done' }))

await runtime.run(flow.toBlueprint())

// You can now inspect the captured events
const startEvent = eventLogger.find('workflow:start')
```

### Benefits

- **Non-Intrusive**: Captures events without modifying workflow logic.
- **Detailed Trace**: Records node executions, context changes, and errors.
- **In-Memory**: Fast and lightweight, ideal for unit tests or local debugging.

## Workflow Replay

Workflow replay enables **time-travel debugging** by reconstructing workflow state from recorded events without re-executing node logic. This is invaluable for debugging failed workflows, analyzing performance issues, or understanding complex state transitions.

### How It Works

When workflows run with persistent event storage, all execution events are captured. The replay system processes these events in order to reconstruct the final workflow state:

- **`node:finish`**: Applies completed node outputs to context
- **`context:change`**: Applies context modifications (including user `context.set()` calls)
- **`node:error`**: Records errors in the workflow state
- **`workflow:finish`**: Marks workflow completion

### Usage

```typescript
import { createFlow, FlowRuntime } from 'flowcraft'
import { PersistentEventBusAdapter, InMemoryEventStore } from 'flowcraft'

// Set up persistent event storage
const eventStore = new InMemoryEventStore()
const eventBus = new PersistentEventBusAdapter(eventStore)
const runtime = new FlowRuntime({ eventBus })

// Create and run a workflow
const flow = createFlow('my-workflow').node('process-data', async ({ context }) => {
	await context.set('result', 'processed')
	return { output: 'done' }
})

const result = await runtime.run(
	flow.toBlueprint(),
	{},
	{ functionRegistry: flow.getFunctionRegistry() },
)

// Later, replay the execution for debugging
const executionId = result.context._executionId
const events = await eventStore.retrieve(executionId)
const replayResult = await runtime.replay(flow.toBlueprint(), events)

// replayResult.context contains the reconstructed final state
console.log(replayResult.context.result) // 'processed'
```

### Benefits

- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Inspect the exact state of any workflow execution at any point
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Reconstruct failed workflow states without re-running expensive operations
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze execution patterns without the overhead of re-execution
- **Testing**: Verify complex state transitions and edge cases
- **Pluggable Storage**: Easy to implement custom event stores (databases, message queues, etc.)

### Event Storage Backends

The replay system is designed to work with any event storage backend. Flowcraft provides:

- **`InMemoryEventStore`**: Simple in-memory implementation for testing and development
- **Custom Implementations**: Implement the `IEventStore` interface for databases, log streams, or message queues

```typescript
interface IEventStore {
	store(event: FlowcraftEvent, executionId: string): Promise<void>
	retrieve(executionId: string): Promise<FlowcraftEvent[]>
	retrieveMultiple(executionIds: string[]): Promise<Map<string, FlowcraftEvent[]>>
}
```

## History Adapters

For persistent event storage in production environments, Flowcraft provides dedicated history adapter packages that implement the `IEventStore` interface for different databases.

### SQLite History Adapter

The `@flowcraft/sqlite-history` package provides SQLite-based event storage, ideal for development, testing, and small-scale production deployments.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install @flowcraft/sqlite-history
```

#### Usage

```typescript
import { SqliteHistoryAdapter } from '@flowcraft/sqlite-history'
import { PersistentEventBusAdapter } from 'flowcraft'

// Create SQLite event store
const eventStore = new SqliteHistoryAdapter({
	databasePath: './workflow-events.db',
	walMode: true, // Enable WAL mode for better concurrent access
})

// Create persistent event bus
const eventBus = new PersistentEventBusAdapter(eventStore)

// Use with Flowcraft runtime
const runtime = new FlowRuntime({ eventBus })

// Events are automatically stored and can be retrieved later
const events = await eventStore.retrieve(executionId)
```

#### Configuration

- `databasePath`: Path to SQLite database file. Use `:memory:` for in-memory storage.
- `walMode`: Enable WAL mode for better concurrent read/write access (default: true).

#### Features

- **Efficient Storage**: SQLite provides fast, reliable event storage
- **Concurrent Access**: WAL mode enables concurrent reads and writes
- **Query Capabilities**: Retrieve events by execution ID or multiple executions
- **Statistics**: Get insights into stored events and executions

### PostgreSQL History Adapter

The `@flowcraft/postgres-history` package provides PostgreSQL-based event storage for enterprise-scale deployments requiring high availability and performance.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install @flowcraft/postgres-history
```

#### Usage

```typescript
import { PostgresHistoryAdapter } from '@flowcraft/postgres-history'
import { PersistentEventBusAdapter } from 'flowcraft'

// Create PostgreSQL event store
const eventStore = new PostgresHistoryAdapter({
	host: 'localhost',
	port: 5432,
	database: 'flowcraft',
	user: 'flowcraft',
	password: 'password',
	tableName: 'workflow_events', // optional, defaults to 'flowcraft_events'
})

// Create persistent event bus
const eventBus = new PersistentEventBusAdapter(eventStore)

// Use with Flowcraft runtime
const runtime = new FlowRuntime({ eventBus })

// Events are automatically stored and can be retrieved later
const events = await eventStore.retrieve(executionId)
```

#### Configuration

All standard `pg.PoolConfig` options are supported:

- `host`, `port`, `database`, `user`, `password`: Database connection details
- `tableName`: Custom table name (default: 'flowcraft_events')
- `autoCreateTables`: Automatically create tables and indexes (default: true)

#### Features

- **Scalable Storage**: PostgreSQL handles high-volume event storage
- **Concurrent Access**: Full support for concurrent reads and writes
- **Advanced Querying**: Leverage PostgreSQL's JSONB for complex event queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management with pg.Pool
- **Statistics**: Get insights into stored events and executions

Both adapters automatically create the necessary database schema on first use and support efficient querying by execution ID.

For CLI tools to inspect and debug workflow executions, see the [CLI Guide](/guide/cli).

## OpenTelemetry

For [distributed](/guide/distributed-execution) tracing and observability, you can use the [`@flowcraft/opentelemetry-middleware`](https://npmjs.com/package/@flowcraft/opentelemetry-middleware) package. This middleware integrates with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to provide end-to-end visibility into workflow executions.

```typescript
import { OpenTelemetryMiddleware } from '@flowcraft/opentelemetry-middleware'
import { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node'
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http'

// Set up OpenTelemetry SDK (standard OTel setup)
const sdk = new NodeSDK({
	traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter(), // Point to Jaeger, Datadog, etc.
})
sdk.start()

// Create the middleware
const otelMiddleware = new OpenTelemetryMiddleware('flowcraft-worker')

// Add to runtime
const runtime = new FlowRuntime({
	middleware: [otelMiddleware],
})
```

This middleware automatically creates spans for each node execution, propagates context between nodes, and records errors, enabling full observability in distributed environments.
