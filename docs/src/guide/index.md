# What is Flowcraft?

**Flowcraft** is a lightweight, unopinionated, and progressively scalable runtime for executing declarative workflows defined as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is designed to reliably orchestrate complex business processes, data pipelines, ETL workflows, or AI agent orchestrations with a focus on simplicity, portability, and extensibility.

## Core Philosophy

Unlike heavy platforms like Temporal or Airflow, or domain-specific libraries like LangChain, Flowcraft is a foundational engine that does one thing exceptionally well: **execute a graph of functions defined as data**. It provides a flexible, type-safe API to define workflows, execute them with resilience, and scale from in-memory scripts to distributed systems without changing the core business logic.

Flowcraft offers two primary ways to author workflows: the battle-tested **Fluent API** for manual graph construction and the new **Compiler** for writing imperative TypeScript code that automatically generates declarative blueprints.

## Key Features

- **Zero Dependencies**: Lightweight and dependency-free, runs in any environment.
- **Declarative Workflows**: Simple [serializable objects](/guide/core-concepts#workflow-blueprint) with [nodes and edges](/guide/core-concepts#nodes-edges).
- **Unopinionated Logic**: Nodes can be simple [functions](/guide/core-concepts#function-based-nodes) or structured [classes](/guide/core-concepts#class-based-nodes).
- **Progressive Scalability**: Run [in-memory](/guide/fluent) or scale to [distributed systems](/guide/distributed-execution).
- **Resilient Execution**: [Retries](/guide/error-handling#retries), [fallbacks](/guide/error-handling#fallbacks), [timeouts](/guide/core-concepts#config), and [cancellation](/guide/core-concepts#cancellation).
- **Advanced Patterns**: Includes [batches](/guide/batches), [loops](/guide/loops), [subflows](/guide/subflows), and [HITL](/guide/hitl) constructs.
- **Extensibility**: Pluggable [loggers](/guide/loggers), [evaluators](/guide/evaluators), [serializers](/guide/serializers), and [middleware](/guide/middleware).
- **Static Analysis**: [Detect cycles](/guide/static-analysis#detecting-cycles), [validate blueprints](/guide/static-analysis#linting-a-blueprint), and [generate diagrams](/guide/visualizing-workflows#generatemermaid).
- **Type-Safe API**: [Fully typed](/guide/core-concepts#context) with TypeScript for a robust developer experience.

## Use Cases

Flowcraft is versatile for various workflow scenarios.

### AI Agents

Build intelligent agents that process data, make decisions, and interact with users.

- **Example**: Research Agent (see [Research Example](https://github.com/gorango/flowcraft/tree/master/examples/ai-workflows/research-assistant))
- **Features**: Conditional branching, LLM integration, human-in-the-loop.

### ETL Pipelines

Extract, transform, and load data efficiently.

- **Example**: Parallel Workflow (see [Translation Example](https://github.com/gorango/flowcraft/tree/master/examples/ai-workflows/translation-service))
- **Features**: Batch processing, parallel execution, error handling.

### Business Process Automation

Automate routine business tasks like approvals and notifications.

- **Example**: HITL Workflow (see [Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)](/guide/hitl))
- **Features**: Awaitable workflows, declarative definitions.

### Distributed Execution

Run workflows across multiple machines or services.

- **Example**: Distributed Workflow (see [Distributed Example](https://github.com/gorango/flowcraft/tree/master/examples/adapters/distributed-execution))
- **Features**: Adapters for queues, persistence.
