This package provides a distributed adapter for [Flowcraft](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowcraft) that is deeply integrated with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) for reliable job queuing and AWS DynamoDB for scalable, low-latency state persistence and coordination.

## Features

- **Distributed Execution**: Natively scale your workflows across multiple workers using managed AWS services.
- **Serverless Job Queuing**: Utilizes AWS SQS for a fully managed message queue that decouples workflow steps.
- **Scalable State & Coordination**: Leverages AWS DynamoDB's performance and scalability for both workflow context persistence and distributed coordination tasks (like fan-in joins), eliminating the need for a separate Redis instance.
- **Workflow Reconciliation**: Includes a reconciler utility to detect and resume stalled workflows, ensuring fault tolerance in production environments.

## Installation

You need to install the core `flowcraft` package along with this adapter and the required AWS SDK v3 modules.

````bash
npm install flowcraft @flowcraft/sqs-adapter @aws-sdk/client-sqs @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb @aws-sdk/util-dynamodb
```

## Prerequisites

To use this adapter, you must have the following AWS resources provisioned:
- An SQS queue to handle jobs.
- Three DynamoDB tables:
    1.  A table to store workflow context.
    2.  A table to store the final status of a workflow run.
    3.  A table for the coordination store (for locks and counters).

**DynamoDB Table Schema Examples:**
- **Context/Status Tables**: Primary key `runId` (String).
- **Coordination Table**: Primary key `coordinationKey` (String). This table should also have a TTL attribute enabled on a `ttl` (Number) field for automatic cleanup of expired locks and counters.

## Usage

The following example demonstrates how to set up and start a worker.

```typescript
import { SQSClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-sqs';
import { DynamoDBClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';
import { FlowRuntime } from 'flowcraft';
import { SqsAdapter, DynamoDbCoordinationStore } from '@flowcraft/sqs-adapter';

// 1. Define your workflow blueprints and registry
const blueprints = { /* your workflow blueprints */ };
const registry = { /* your node implementations */ };

// 2. Initialize AWS service clients
const awsConfig = { region: 'us-east-1' };
const sqsClient = new SQSClient(awsConfig);
const dynamoDbClient = new DynamoDBClient(awsConfig);

// 3. Create a runtime configuration
const runtime = new FlowRuntime({ blueprints, registry });

// 4. Set up the coordination store using DynamoDB
const coordinationStore = new DynamoDbCoordinationStore({
  client: dynamoDbClient,
  tableName: 'flowcraft-coordination',
});

// 5. Initialize the adapter
const adapter = new SqsAdapter({
  runtimeOptions: runtime.options,
  coordinationStore,
  sqsClient,
  dynamoDbClient,
  queueUrl: 'YOUR_SQS_QUEUE_URL',
  contextTableName: 'flowcraft-contexts',
  statusTableName: 'flowcraft-statuses',
});

// 6. Start the worker to begin polling the SQS queue
adapter.start();

console.log('Flowcraft worker with SQS adapter is running...');
```

### Serverless Usage (AWS Lambda)

You can also run workflows serverlessly by deploying a Lambda function triggered by SQS. The adapter exposes a public `handleJob()` method for per-invocation processing:

```typescript
import type { SQSEvent, SQSHandler } from 'aws-lambda'
import { SqsAdapter, DynamoDbCoordinationStore } from '@flowcraft/sqs-adapter'

// Initialize adapter (same as above)
const adapter = new SqsAdapter({ /* ... */ })

export const handler: SQSHandler = async (event) => {
  for (const record of event.Records) {
    const job = JSON.parse(record.body || '{}')
    await adapter.handleJob(job)
  }
}
```

Set your Lambda's SQS event source mapping to `batch_size = 1` for stateless processing.

### Serverless Usage (AWS Lambda)

You can also run workflows serverlessly by deploying a Lambda function triggered by SQS. The adapter exposes a public `handleJob()` method for per-invocation processing:

```typescript
import type { SQSEvent, SQSHandler } from 'aws-lambda'
import { SqsAdapter, DynamoDbCoordinationStore } from '@flowcraft/sqs-adapter'

// Initialize adapter (same as above)
const adapter = new SqsAdapter({ /* ... */ })

export const handler: SQSHandler = async (event) => {
  for (const record of event.Records) {
    const job = JSON.parse(record.body || '{}')
    await adapter.handleJob(job)
  }
}
```

Set your Lambda's SQS event source mapping to `batch_size = 1` for stateless processing.`

## Components

- **`SqsAdapter`**: The main adapter class that polls an SQS queue for jobs, executes them via the `FlowRuntime`, and enqueues subsequent jobs.
- **`DynamoDbContext`**: An `IAsyncContext` implementation that stores and retrieves workflow state from a specified DynamoDB table.
- **`DynamoDbCoordinationStore`**: An `ICoordinationStore` implementation that uses DynamoDB's atomic update and conditional expression features to handle distributed coordination without needing a separate service.
- **`createSqsReconciler`**: A utility function for creating a reconciler that queries DynamoDB for stalled workflows and resumes them.

## Reconciliation

The SQS adapter includes a reconciliation utility that helps detect and resume stalled workflows. This is particularly useful in production environments where workers might crash or be restarted.

### Prerequisites for Reconciliation

To use reconciliation, your status table must include a `lastUpdated` field that tracks when workflows were last active. The adapter automatically updates this field during job processing.

### Usage

```typescript
import { createSqsReconciler } from '@flowcraft/sqs-adapter'

// Create a reconciler instance
const reconciler = createSqsReconciler({
	adapter: mySqsAdapter,
	dynamoDbClient: myDynamoClient,
	statusTableName: 'flowcraft-statuses',
	stalledThresholdSeconds: 300, // 5 minutes
})

// Run reconciliation
const stats = await reconciler.run()
console.log(
	`Scanned ${stats.scannedItems} items, found ${stats.stalledRuns} stalled runs, reconciled ${stats.reconciledRuns} runs`,
)
```

### Reconciliation Stats

The reconciler returns detailed statistics:

```typescript
interface ReconciliationStats {
	scannedItems: number // Number of DynamoDB items scanned
	stalledRuns: number // Number of workflows identified as stalled
	reconciledRuns: number // Number of workflows successfully resumed
	failedRuns: number // Number of reconciliation attempts that failed
}
```

### How It Works

The reconciler queries the status table for workflows with `status = 'running'` that haven't been updated within the threshold period. For each stalled workflow, it:

1. Loads the workflow's current state from the context table
2. Determines which nodes are ready to execute based on completed predecessors
3. Acquires appropriate locks to prevent race conditions
4. Enqueues jobs for ready nodes via SQS

This ensures that workflows can be resumed even after worker failures or restarts.
