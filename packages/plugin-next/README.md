# @flowcraft/next-plugin

Next.js plugin for automatic Flowcraft workflow compilation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @flowcraft/next-plugin
```

## Usage

Update your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const { withFlowcraft } = require('@flowcraft/next-plugin')

module.exports = withFlowcraft({
	// ... your Next.js config
})
```

Your Flowcraft workflows will be automatically compiled during production builds.

## Development Mode

For development, the plugin currently only runs during production builds to avoid conflicts with Next.js Fast Refresh. You can run the compiler manually or set up a file watcher:

```bash
# Run once
npx @flowcraft/compiler

# Or set up a watcher
npx @flowcraft/compiler --watch
```

See the [@flowcraft/compiler README](../compiler/README.md) for more details.
