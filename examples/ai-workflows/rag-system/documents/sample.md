# Data-Driven Workflows

While Flowcraft's fluent `.node()` and `.edge()` API is great for defining workflows in code, one of the framework's most powerful features is its ability to execute workflows from **serializable JSON objects** (the `WorkflowBlueprint`).

This decouples your business logic from the workflow's structure, enabling you to:

- Build visual drag-and-drop workflow editors.
- Allow non-developers to configure or modify business processes.
- Store workflow definitions in a database.
- Dynamically generate and execute workflows in AI agent systems.

## Registry + Blueprint + Runtime

The core pattern involves three components:

1.  **Node Registry**: A central map where you register your reusable node functions (e.g., `llm-process`, `send-email`) under a simple string key.
2.  **Workflow Blueprint**: A JSON file that defines the nodes and edges, referencing the node implementations by their string keys.
3.  **FlowRuntime**: The engine, configured with the registry, that can load and execute any blueprint.

## Example: Content Moderation

The **[Dynamic AI Agent example](/examples/ai-workflows/in-memory-processing)** demonstrates this perfectly. The entire moderation logic is defined in [`400.json`](https://github.com/gorango/flowcraft/tree/master/examples/ai-workflows/declarative-processing/data/4.content-moderation/400.json).

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Content Moderation (ID: 400)"
        A(User Post) --> B[check_for_pii] & C[check_for_hate_speech] & D[check_for_spam]
        B & C & D --> E{triage_post}
        E -- action_ban --> F["Sub-Workflow: Ban User"]
        E -- action_redact --> G["Sub-Workflow: Redact Post"]
        E -- action_approve --> I[approve_post_branch]
    end
```

A node in the JSON looks like this:

```json
{
	"id": "check_for_pii",
	"uses": "llm-condition", // Key from our Node Registry
	"data": {
		"promptTemplate": "Does this text contain PII? Respond 'true' or 'false'.\n\nText: \"{{userPost}}\"",
		"inputs": {
			"userPost": "userPost" // Read 'userPost' from the context
		}
	}
}
```

The runtime dynamically constructs and executes this graph. This approach means you can add a new moderation rule (e.g., `check_for_profanity`) by simply adding a new node to the JSON and a new edge to the `triage_post` router, with **no changes to the application code**.

> [!TIP]
> This data-driven approach is the key to building scalable and maintainable systems. When you separate the "what" (the JSON graph) from the "how" (the node implementations), your system becomes incredibly flexible.
